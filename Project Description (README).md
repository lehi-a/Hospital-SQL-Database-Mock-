# Hospital-SQL-Database-Mock-

The project was to simulate a healthcare scenerio where a hospital would need a database with multiple tables to store and retrieve information regarding patients, employees, room vacancies, medicine stocks, etc. -- as well as be able to run stored queries (with agregations) to generate reports. 

Project Highlights:

* SQL code that creates the appropriate tables, attributes, keys, data types and dependencies
* Insert commands that input mock data to test queries
* Multiple stored queries which highlight different important data that could be included on reports
